# HikingLog

Living in the PNW, I've been going hiking very often during quarantine, so I decided to make a program that tracks all of my hikes and my miles hiked/elevation gained during this season! 

Created a hiking log to record completed hikes; tracks total miles and elevation climbed throughout the year

HikeInfo.java sets up what data a hike can provide

HikingLog.java is the actual program, uses HikeInfo and doubly linked lists to keep a record of completed hikes

HikingJournal.java is an example test code
