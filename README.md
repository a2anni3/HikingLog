# HikingLog
Created a hiking log to record completed hikes; tracks total miles and elevation climbed throughout the year

HikeInfo sets up what data a hike can provide
HikingLog is the actual program, uses HikeInfo and doubly linked lists to keep a record of completed hikes
HikingJournal is an example test code
